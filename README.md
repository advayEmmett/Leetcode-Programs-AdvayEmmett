# Leetcode-Programs by **_Advay Emmett_**

Efficient and optimized Java solutions for popular LeetCode problems — focused on clean code, algorithmic thinking, and
real performance improvements.

## About This Repository

This repository contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems that I’ve solved to strengthen:

* > Problem-solving and logic building

* > Understanding of algorithms and data structures

* > Code optimization and performance analysis

I use this repo to track progress and share techniques like two-pointers, dynamic programming, recursion, sliding
window, and more.
<p>Each and every possible versions of problems are attached with labels like "Normal", "Optimized", etc. </p>

## Some Highlights

1. > To find **Longest Palindromic Substring**
   <br><p>Optimized from 131 ms -> 8 ms using char[], pointer logic and smart formulas.

## Languages Used

Java (Primary)<br>
Occasional language experiments

## Learning Focus

“Write clean, efficient, and readable code that balances logic and performance.”

My actual goal is not to master Java but to master real life problem-solving, which develops approach and help find path
to tackle challenges in projects.<br>
Language can be any, but the concept and technique remain same **always**.
